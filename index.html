    <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <!--Poem-->
    <p>
      I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
      Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
      Stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand,<br />
      Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
      And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
      Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
      Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
      The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
      And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br/>
      My name is <span class="underline">Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br/>
      Lookonmy Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br/>
      Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
      Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
      The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br/>
    </p>
